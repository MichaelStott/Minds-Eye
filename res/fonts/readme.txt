I didn't make the original font; I did, however, make this font,which is based very heavily on the original font.	If you like this font, feel free to let me know! My website, which containsother things I've done, is located at http://www.soixantedeux.co.nr/, or ifthat doesn't work, http://www.freewebtown.com/62/. If you have any questionsregarding this font, contact me. Also, if you use this font somewhere andyou're particularly proud of the way you used it, don't hesitate to let meknow. :) I'm interested in what will happen to this font after I put it up fordownload on my website.	Thanks for downloading Venice!																		soixantedeux
