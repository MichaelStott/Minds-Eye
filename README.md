------

An experimental Sokoban-esque puzzle game developed using Rust and SDL2. Very much a WIP. :construction_worker:

The objective is to move the colored blocks into the line of sight of a matching eye.

## Build

### Windows

If compiling for the first time, first pull the SDL2 dependencies for the project via:

```sh
$ make deps
```

This will download the SDL2 libraries in a new `lib` folder.

To launch the project in development mode, run

```sh
$ make dev
```
